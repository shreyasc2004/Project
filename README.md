# EXPENSE TRACKING APP - SPENTIT

* Hi, this is an Expense Tracking App created by me and my team, including my dearest friend ChatGPT.
* The concept of this app is that without any need for an API and using text parsing, you can just paste your transaction messages, and voila, all your expenses are added.
* Right now, it's working for SBI messages. USE THESE MESSAGES FOR TEST:
